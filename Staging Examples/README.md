staging methods

  1. check for flamed out engines
     - filtered engine list
     - unfiltered engine list
  1. thrust
     - loop form
       - lack of thrust
       - thrust delta fraction
       - thrust delta threshold
     - trigger form
       - lack of thrust
       - thrust delta fraction
       - thrust delta threshold
  1. resource
     - global thresholds
       - loop form
       - trigger form
     - tagged tanks
     - above engines
       - filtered engine list
       - unfiltered engine list
     - engines to resource cast
       - filtered engine list
       - unfiltered engine list
  1. time
     - loop form
       - time delta between staging events
       - elapsed time since start
     - trigger form
       - time delta between staging events
       - elapsed time since start
